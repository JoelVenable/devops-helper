# DevOps-Helper
Base image to facilitate DevOps in GitLab with deploy to AWS - includes aws tools, docker, python.

## Why
It was difficult finding a base image gitlab could run that had all required tools in one image. We created this image to simplify our .gitlab-ci scripts as it contains everything required for our AWS-based CI/CD processes.
